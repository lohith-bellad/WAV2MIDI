####Monophonic Musical Note Recognition and WAV to MIDI conversion

This is a small piece of code which runs in MATLAB(scientific tool) producing MIDI output of the input monophonic audio file.

The input audio file has to be in WAV format and needs to be monophonic. Polyphonic music files are not supported yet. There are some sample monophonic audio files in the folders named "Classical" and "Western".

This code requires MIDI toolbox for MATLAB which is freely available [MIDI Toolbox](https://github.com/miditoolbox/). After successfully installing the toolbox. Run the MATLAB(.m) files depending on the music type (Classical or Western) with the input audio files.

The code will convert the WAV file to MIDI file which you can later use with MIDI synthesizer softwares like APPLE Garageband for music composition.

Hope this code will find its right use. Have fun!!!
